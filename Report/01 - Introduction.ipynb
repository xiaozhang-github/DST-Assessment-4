    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment, we selected the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, which contains benign traffic and the latest common attacks. Compared with the outdated data set such as kddcup99, it looks more like real-world data(PCAPs) and is meaningful for the training, testing and verification of IDSs and IPSs. And we selected Wednesday's dataset, which included benign, four DOS attacks and Heartbleed attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "In this assessment we explored deep learning models for the network intrusion detection. We chose FFNN and Autoencoder followed by FFNN respectively, wanting to compare the  performance of semi-supervised methods(AE+FFNN) with the supervised feed-forward neural network(FFNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really a new challenge for us--new methods and new platform. We did part of the work on HPC.\n",

    "[02 - EDA and Preprocessing](https://github.com/xiaozhang-github/DST-Assessment-4/blob/main/Report/02%20-%20EDA%20and%20Preprocessing.ipynb) Exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing, as well as research on the importance of scaling. \n",

    "[03 - FFNN](https://github.com/xiaozhang-github/DST-Assessment-4/blob/main/Report/03%20-%20FFNN.ipynb) FFNN model and Hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "[04 - Autoencoder](https://github.com/xiaozhang-github/DST-Assessment-4/blob/main/Report/04%20-%20Autoencoder.ipynb) Autoencoder (followed by FFNN) model and Hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "[05 - Performance comparison and Conclusion](https://github.com/xiaozhang-github/DST-Assessment-4/blob/main/Report/05%20-%20Performance%20comparison%20and%20Conclusion.ipynb) We compare the performance of the above two models, and compare some traditional machine learning methods with the deep learning of this research.
