# 01 - Introduction
### In this project we explored deep learning models for the network intrusion detection. We chose FFNN and Autoencoder followed by FFNN respectively, wanting to compare the 
performance of semi-supervised methods(AE+FFNN) with the supervised feed-forward neural network(FFNN).

We applied our models to CIC-IDS2017 datasets, which was recorded in a small network environment with simulated normal traffic. It possesses 78 features and 12 classes that we
would explore in the next sections. And six categories of modern attacks are launched from a separate network.It is representative of modern network traffic.

This project is a new challenge for us--new methods and new platform. We did part of the work on HPC, and there is still some work that is not comprehensive enough because of
technological barriers--some of the work didn't run successfully on HPC.

The models we used for doing classification are FFNN and AE+FFNN,
 FFNN:
 AE+FFNN: in this part we split the training set of the IDS2017 dataset into 75%-25%. The first 75%(label removed) was used during the unsupervised training phase, and the second
 25% was used in the supervised training phase. We transformed the training data by encoder before doing classification.
